When it snows in winter 
red roses bloom on cold cheeks
that wither in warmth.
But in summer,
the sun kissed your skin
staining it red like lipstick.
Sand tickles your feet. 
Have you seen that red,
golden leaves paint the ground
like a sunset sky
Trees wear floral wreaths
and birds sing the welcoming
melody of spring
Rain sometimes means gloomy days
but sometimes for flowers to
grow they need tough love
Itâ€™s okay to cry.
The heavens cry too and their
tears make flowers bloom
